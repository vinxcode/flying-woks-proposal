# Flying Woks website redesign proposal

I will develop a proposal for Flying Woks. This website must have the following things:

- Clean, intuitive and modern design
- SEO
- Easy to navigate
- 2 factor authentication
- Dark/light mode
- Payments

### Stack
By the moment I am using Astro for a proposal of design, but I don't discard to use Nextjs in the future. It's possible that the project migrates to PWA instead of a simple SPA or website.
